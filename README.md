# HistoricalBrassBronzeAnalysis

Worked with data supplied by Arlen Heginbotham and Yannick Chastang from the Getty Museum on the amounts of chemical elements within brass and bronze pieces of furniture to make plots to see a relationship between elemental content and year of origin. Future planning to use this info to make a model to predict dates of unknown furniture.
